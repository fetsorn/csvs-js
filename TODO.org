#+title: Todo

 - core and shell pattern
   - figure out what files need to be fetched for method
   - fetch all files into a map
   - pass the map of metadir to pure functions
   - pure functions get a read map, and return a write map
   - write all files in write map with a callback
   - unit test IO shell with mock metadir folders and map objects

 - remove "label" entity

 - have an abstract delete prop function
   - prunes all branches of a prop

 - use either forEach of for..of uniformly
   - they are equivalent in speed for this scale
   - but linter might like forEach

 - use arrays of values in query maps everywhere
   - right now only in branches of 'array' props
   - might help unify codebase

 - queryMetadir for a given root
   - i.e. query all instances of a particular 'object' prop
